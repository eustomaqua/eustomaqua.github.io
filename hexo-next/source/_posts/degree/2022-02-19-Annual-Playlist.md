Seems you've been changing lately
I can feel the distance in your touch
There's two people in this hallway
But there's only one of us
That's tryna keep this fire going
Should I just give up?
I sense trouble on the horizon
I'm afraid our time is up

The clouds are rolling in, I feel you drifting away
And though my intuition tells me that it's too late
That in these conditions, tryna bring back the flame is like
Tryna light a match in the rain

I still want to make you love me, make you love me again
Even though my intuition tells me that it's the end
That in these conditions tryna bring back the flame is like
Tryna light a match in the rain

Yeah, I can taste it, it's the end
This love's impossible to save
Though you embrace it, I can't face it
So I look the other way
There's trouble in your eyes
But I pretend that we're okay
I wish that we could compromise
But there's just nothin' left to say

The clouds are rolling in, I feel you drifting away
And though my intuition tells me that it's too late
That in these conditions, tryna bring back the flame is like
Tryna light a match in the rain

I still want to make you love me, make you love me again
Even though my intuition tells me that it's the end
That in these conditions tryna bring back the flame is like
Tryna light a match in the rain

Tryna light a match in the rain
Like flyin' a kite in a hurricane
Like ridin' a bike with no air chain
On a broken road, it's a losing game
Tryna light a match in the rain
Like flyin' a kite in a hurricane
Like ridin' a bike with no air chain
On a broken road, it's a losing game

The clouds are rolling in, I feel you drifting away
And though my intuition tells me that it's too late
That in these conditions, tryna bring back the flame is like
Tryna light a match in the rain

I still want to make you love me, make you love me again
Even though my intuition tells me that it's the end
That in these conditions tryna bring back the flame is like
Tryna light a match in the rain

I'm sorry that I did this
The blood is on my hands
I stare at my reflection
I don't know who I am
Practice my confession
In case I take the stand
I'll say I learned my lesson
I'll be a better man

I'm packing up my things
And I'm wiping down the walls
I'm rinsing off my clothes
And I'm walking through the halls
I did it all for her
So I felt nothing at all
I don't know what she'll say
So I'll ask her when she calls

Can't you see I'm running?
Said I need a place to hide
I've gotta ask you something
Could you please let me inside?
Just let me explain
No, I wouldn't tell you lies
I know you'll understand
If you let me stay the night

You have to understand that
The one I killed is me
Changing what I was
For what you wanted me to be
I followed your direction
Did everything you asked
I hope that makes you happy
'Cause there's just no turning back

The way you felt in my arms
Our chemistry was sacred
Oh, I fell for your charm
I was so infatuated
But you left me in the dark
And my heart completely vacant
Now I don't know oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

How you could look me in the eye
And tell me that you love me
When you knew it was a lie
I was headed for Kentucky
When you called to say goodbye
How did I not see it coming?
Now I don't know oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

I can take rejection
But you gave the impression
That this was the inception
Of something real

I don't live in California
I'll inform ya
That's not where I reside
I'm just a tenant payin' rent
Inside this body and I
Got two windows
And those windows
Well, I call them my eyes
I'm just goin' where the wind blows
I don't get to decide

Then I tied up my linen with
Five strips of ribbon I found
Scaled the side of the buildin'
I ran to the hills 'til they found me
And they put me back in my cell
All by myself
Alone with my thoughts again
Guess my mind is a prison and
I'm never gonna get out

Said even if it's true
No matter what I do
I'm never gonna escape
I won't give up on hope
Secure another rope
And try for another day

Outrunning karma, that boy
He's such a charmer, all the
Bugs and their larva follow
Him out to Colorado
Ten-dozen hearts in a bag
Their bodies lyin', he'll drag
Them down to Colorado
A modern desperado

And he'll race for miles through the night
He runs because he knows he cannot hide

He's never gonna make it, all the
Poor people he's forsaken, karma
Is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting from the
Church steeple down to Satan karma
There's really no escape until he dies

## 大雪寄家书

https://music.163.com/#/song?id=1841921621
https://y.qq.com/n/ryqq/songDetail/000urqSU2erZNX

**大雪寄家书**
词：Finale
曲：河图
埙：笛呆子囚牛
别的：河图

刘氏的儿子去北岭从军，说好会写信回家。开始信三月一封，第三年后间隔越来越长，内容也颠三倒四，第五年就再没有信来。这年冬天，北岭传来消息，儿子所在的那支军队打了场历时三年的战，最终无人生还。刘氏伏地大哭。她不识字，但她认得信里的“娘”字，儿子后来的信里，“娘”字都写得不尽相同。
“等北岭下了第一场雪，我们就回家。”

它走了三千里路 穿越过昼夜边界 从大雪走到小雪
驿站里寻常交接 信封有干涸的血
它来自哪座城池 要去向哪个誓约 带给谁悲伤或喜悦
白发人等候多年 等一场迟来的生死离别
西风烈 谁望西风吹冷城阙
谁倾听羌笛幽咽 谁守着一座城期待落雪
羌笛咽 谁百战归 谁把家书续写
谁问故乡月 几回圆缺
纸上泪下也 寒光照甲 世间谁心如铁
纵谁胆怯 也含笑告别

它听过人间哭笑 看战火开始终结 从小雪走到大雪
传递间信封残缺 所幸留墨迹真切
它躺在黄昏灯下 承载她眼神殷切 无论以谎言或慰藉
风雪中消息凛冽 她记得那个字长短横斜
西风烈 谁念西风吹冷城阙
夜来有羌笛幽咽 那座城孤独地迎接落雪
羌笛咽 千里未竭 应是乡愁难解
可怜故乡月 几回圆缺
白发泪下也 红蜡成灰 世间原来易别
今夜有雪 似归家季节

羌笛咽 千里未竭，应是乡愁难解
可怜故乡月 几回圆缺
白发泪下也 红蜡成灰 世间原来易别
今夜有雪 似归家季节

箫：水玥儿
电吉他：litterzy


林间几度枯荣叶转风轻
雨落寂寞冢 年年清明
犹记前尘 身世飘零半言定
此生多坎坷 我命照孤星

第一杯祭天祭地 祭岁月冷清
第二杯祭你祭我 祭少年狂行
第三杯饮尽 无人共醉也酩酊
不负生 不负死 不负六欲七情

我走 我停 我逐的是我影
人间有孤鸾一剑伶仃
对浩荡青冥
我笑 我疯 我破的是我命
这大梦十年方觉醒 天下谁听

山河问我姓我名 五岳来迎
剑光照雪惊碎了江湖浪静
红尘路上有几个爱恨随心
愿翻云覆雨 愿乱世不见刀兵

日月问我仇我情 四海也倾
未负生死却负你好风良景
功与过是拍痛双肩的刑
谁应帝王名

第一剑为苦为难 为苍生无幸
第二剑为恩为怨 为还报有凭
第三剑斩尽 虽千万人我独行
不悔生 不悔死 不悔身后论评

我走 我停 我逐的是我影
人间有孤鸾一剑伶仃
对浩荡青冥
我笑 我疯 我破的是我命
这大梦十年方觉醒 天下谁听

山河问我姓我名 五岳来迎
剑光照雪惊碎了江湖浪静
红尘路上有几个爱恨随心
愿翻云覆雨 愿乱世不见刀兵

日月问我仇我情 四海也倾
未负生死却负你好风良景
功与过是拍痛双肩的刑
谁应帝王名
