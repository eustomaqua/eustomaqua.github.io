This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake
Don't cut me down, throw me out,
Leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door
Don't cut me down, throw me out
Leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly (Let me down slowly)
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

I hold on to little pieces of what we were
I know we're long gone, but take it easy
Because it hurts
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a girl with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

夜晚寒意由此蔓延
你仿佛渐行渐远
从厨房一直到浴室水槽
你离开的脚步让我苏醒
不要让我分崩离析，不要让我形单影只，不要将我随手抛弃
我曾是有尊严有骄傲的男人
如今已经身陷囹圄，困在你这寒冷且逐渐破碎的拥抱中
我恳求你
不要让我瞬间落入深渊
我祈求得到你残存的一丝善意
你的离去会让我孤独
如果你一定要离去，请不要让我瞬间落入深渊
落入深渊
深不见底
落入深渊
无所适从
落入深渊
你的离去会让我孤独
如果你一定要离去，请不要让我瞬间落入深渊
我守护着我们曾经的点点滴滴
我知道一切都已逝去，但请接受吧
因为痛苦终将来临
不要让我分崩离析，不要让我形单影只，不要将我随手抛弃
我曾是优雅而知性的女子
如今已经身陷囹圄，困在你这寒冷且逐渐破碎的拥抱中
我恳求你
不要让我瞬间落入深渊
我祈求得到你残存的一丝善意
你的离去会让我孤独
如果你一定要离去，请不要让我瞬间落入深渊
落入深渊
深不见底
落入深渊
无所适从
落入深渊
你的离去会让我孤独
如果你一定要离去，请不要让我瞬间落入深渊
我无法爬出这万丈深渊
我在不停下落
我无法从悲伤中走出
我在不停沉沦
不要让我瞬间落入深渊
我祈求得到你残存的一丝善意
你的离去会让我孤独
如果你一定要离去，请不要让我瞬间落入深渊
落入深渊
深不见底
落入深渊
无所适从
落入深渊
你的离去会让我孤独
如果你一定要离去，请不要让我瞬间落入深渊（不要让我瞬间落入深渊）
如果你一定要离去，请不要让我瞬间落入深渊
如果你一定要离去，请不要让我瞬间落入深渊

**The Lord of the Rings**
- The Fellowship of the Ring
- The Two Towers
- The Return of the King

I watched THE LORD OF THE RINGS, again. In the cinema. I thought Legolas was handsome once, like six or seven years ago? But this time I found Aragorn, Eowyn, and Faramir were nice as well. My favourite part of LOTR is the beginning, Galadriel describing the story, 'History became legend, legend became myth.'

> The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the Earth. I smell it in the air. Much that once was is lost. For none now live who remember it. It began with the forging of the great rings. Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men --- who above all else, desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master ring, to control all others. And into this Ring, he poured his cruelty, his malice, and his will to dominate all life. One Ring to rule them all. One by one, the free lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the slopes of Mount Doom they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory was near. But the power of the Ring could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the King, took up his father's sword. Sauron, the enemy of the free-peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. But the hearts of Men are easily corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur… …to his death. And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend, legend became myth, and for two and a half thousand years, the Ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared a new bearer. The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there, it consumed him. The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forest of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the east, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived its time had now come. It abandoned Gollum. But something happened then the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. A Hobbit: Bilbo Baggins of the Shire. For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

Now I could recognize Merry and Pippin from each other. I like the scenes when Ents joined the war. It was cute an Ent on the fire dropped himself in the water. Haldir was the one leading them to Galadriel. I was sad when he died. Eowyn always wanted to fight, she took up a sword in the palace.

I started to feel that Freddie Highmore's acting skill is not as good as Timothee Chalamet's. I realized it from the beach scenes in LITTLE WOMEN. Laurie said 'I know something you don't know~', seems that everyone could feel his happiness. But the way Thom talked (in WAY DOWN) doesn't feel much different from that he usually talked.
