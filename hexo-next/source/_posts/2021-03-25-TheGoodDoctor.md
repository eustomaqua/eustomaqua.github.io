**Faded**
*Singer: Alan Walker*

You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another start
You fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us
Alive

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

Where are you now?
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream
The monsters running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded

These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go -- A deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea -- I'm breathing
Alive

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Under the bright -- but faded lights
You've set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Where are you now?
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream
The monsters running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded



**The Good Doctor (S04E12)**

Shaun: I used to think being a doctor was all I needed to make me happy. It did make me happy. But I realized I wanted more, and that I could have more. I changed. You can change, too. But not if you're dead from this surgery. 
Silas: I've made up my mind. Please leave.
Shaun: My brother Steve, he gave me a plastic scalpel before he died. It broke. I was very sad.
Silas: I asked you to leave.
Shaun: When I fixed my scalpel, it made me feel better.

He brought out a yellow mug just like the broken one and put it on the small tea table between them. Then He stood up and walked away. But suddenly Silas started to talk before he walked out of the door.

Silas: I was nine years old when my father died. I loved drinking hot chocolate with him in the morning. He'd bring me a mug after every business trip. He understood me. My mother didn't. Nobody did. I tried fitting in, but... I got frustrated. So I gave up. On relationships. On friends. On all but the one thing I was good at. And now, Dr. Murphy, I'm too old. I've made too many enemies, too many mistakes. People tolerate me because I save lives. Without that, why would anyone ever care about me?

That's why he would rather make a risky choice and insisted that he could live and die with that. That's why only Shaun recognized his autism. When Dr. Andrews said, 'When you dedicate your life to something, that gives you meaning, it starts to define you. His decision may be irrational, but I get it.' Dr. Murphy was the only one who proposed a different opinion, 'I don't think it is irrational. Dr. Chambers has no friends, no children, no family, no outside interests. If he can't be a surgeon, he'll have nothing.'

People don't share the same joys or sorrows. We might understand only those who stand in similar situations as us. Sometimes I felt that we were all alone in the end. Life is meaningless. 'We all die alone.' George said in THE ART OF GETTING BY. 'Of recorded history, something like 110 billion human beings have been born into this world. And not a single one of them made it. There are 6.8 billion people on the planet. Roughly 60 million of them die every year. 60 million people. That comes out to about 160,000 per day. I read this quote once when I was a kid, "We live alone, we die alone. Everything else is just an illusion." It used to keep me up at night.'

What used to keep me up at night. I just learned there are different ways to ask questions. I used to keep them all go up which is probably wrong. I learned it from YouTube. 'Different questions require different intonation. Intonation is the rise and fall of our voice when we speak. There are four different types of questions we have in English. First, yes/no questions using rising intonation at the end of those questions indicate that we're looking for a short answer, no need for more details, we just want something quick or confirmed information. Second, question word questions require longer answers and make it easier to keep the conversation going on and learn something interesting along the way. When our voice goes down, it indicates that we're finished speaking and we're waiting for a longer answer to our question. Third, choice questions use a combination of rising intonation and falling intonation, and doing so makes it immediately clear that I'm offering different choices. With option number one my voice goes up and in the last option, my voice goes down, letting the listener know that the list is finished. Last, using intonation can turn any statements into questions without changing the grammar structure or using a typical question format. We often use this type of question when we're surprised or shocked by something, when we want to make sure that we understood something correctly or clarify it, and when we simply want to add variety to our grammar use.'

I got lost again. What used to keep me up at night. I was trying to say that I felt sorry for the vicissitudes of life in literature. That used to keep me up at night. AS PRETTY AS LIBERTY. What a lovely name. I saw the movie PERSIAN LESSONS last week. To be honest, it didn't touch me during the watch until the end. Out of nowhere, tears just came out along with the names spoken by the lucky man who got a chance to run away. Lives, mysterious.

I found something interesting on GitHub yesterday. A guy wrote 'I (NAME the author) don't care what you do with this' to give the permit. The tone was funny. Then, I was told that there was a license that was much more amusing, dwtfyw (do wtf you want). Interesting.
