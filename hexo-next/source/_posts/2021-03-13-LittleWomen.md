**Wonderful U**
*Singer: AGA*

I never knew.
When the clock stopped and I'm looking at you
I never thought I'll miss someone like you
Someone I thought that I knew

I never knew.
I should have known something wouldn't be true
Baby you know that I'm so into you
More than I know I should do

So why? why? why?
Why should we waited?
And I, I, I, I should be waiting
Waiting for someone new
Even though that it wasn't you

But I know that it's, Wonderful.
Incredible, Baby irrational
I never knew it was obsessional
And I never knew it was with you oooh...
Baby if it's just, Wonderful.
Incredible, Baby irrational
I never knew it was so sad, just so sad
I'm so sorry.
Even now I just cannot feel you feel me
hmmm....hmmm....

So why? why? why?
Why should we waited?
And I, I, I, I should be waiting
Waiting for someone new
Even though that it wasn't you

But I know that it's, Wonderful.
Incredible, Baby irrational
I never knew it was obsessional
And I never knew it was with you oooh...
Baby if it's just, Wonderful.
Incredible, Baby irrational
I never knew it was so sad, just so sad
I'm so sorry.
Even now I just cannot feel you fall

I don't even know now.
I'm sure you'll wait for me
Even now I just cannot deny.
I just hold on so tight
Until you and I never could breathe

Oh, Wonderful.
Incredible, Baby irrational
I never knew it was obsessional
And I never knew it was with you until you tell me to
Baby if it's just, Wonderful.
Incredible, Baby irrational
I never knew it was so sad, just so sad
I'm so sorry.
Even now I just cannot feel you feel me

我从未知晓
当我凝望你之时 时间恍若戛然而止
我未曾想过会对你如此念念不忘
那个我曾认为对其一切都了如指掌的人
我也从不知道
或许我早该明白有些事并非能够得偿所愿
亲爱的 你应知我是多么沉醉痴迷于你
逾越我应保持冷静的界线

所以为何
我们为何苦苦等待
或许我本就应在此等候
昂首期盼新人而至
即便那人并不是你

我也会知道这是多么美妙的事情
令人难以置信 亲爱的 这甚至有些捉摸不透
我从未想过会深陷这无法抗拒的感受之中
我也从未想过是与你相伴
亲爱的 这种感觉精妙绝伦
令人难以置信 亲爱的 这甚至有些捉摸不透
而我却从不知这会如此令人悲恸欲绝
我对此深表歉意
甚至如今我都无法感受你所感知我爱的温热


所以为何
我们为何苦苦等待
或许我本就应在此等候
昂首期盼新人而至
即便那人并不是你

我也会知道这是多么美妙的事情
令人难以置信 亲爱的 这甚至有些捉摸不透
我从未想过会深陷这无法抗拒的感受之中
我也从未想过是与你相伴
亲爱的 这种感觉精妙绝伦
令人难以置信 亲爱的 这甚至有些捉摸不透
而我却从不知这会如此令人悲恸欲绝
我对此深表歉意
甚至如今我都无法感受到你已深深沦陷


我甚至都不知道
也不确定是否你将为我等候
即便如今 我也不可否认
只是紧紧将你拥入怀中
直至我们气咽声丝于这依偎间
.
精妙绝伦
令人难以置信 亲爱的 这甚至有些捉摸不透
我从未想过会深陷这无法抗拒的感受之中
我也从未想过是与你相伴直至你告知于我
亲爱的 这种感觉精妙绝伦
令人难以置信 亲爱的 这甚至有些捉摸不透
而我却从不知这会如此令人悲恸欲绝
我对此深表歉意
甚至如今我都无法感受你所感知我爱的温热

**Little Women**

Laurie and Jo walked through the woods together, as they had done for years. And then Laurie told her how he felt about her all the time, as he said, "We've got to have it out." He said, "I've loved you ever since I've known you Jo -- I couldn't help it, and you've been so good to me -- I've tried to show it but you wouldn't let me; now I'm going to make you hear and give me an answer because... I can't go on like this any longer. I've worked hard to please you, and I gave up billiards and everything you didn't like, and waited and never complained because... I figured you'd love me, Jo, ... I can't love anyone else, Jo. I only love you. ... though I'm not half good enough -- I'd be a perfect saint..."

He said "Is there anything more?" after she turned him down, devastated, depressed. Yet he turned back and walked up to her hearing her saying "except that...", like a desperate person who happened to get driftwood. The only thing he got is her saying "I don't believe I will ever marry. I'm happy as I am, and I love my liberty too well to be in any hurry to give it up." He refused to believe that, "I think you're wrong. I think you will marry, Jo. I think you'll find someone and love him, and you will live and die for him because that's your way, and you will... (a long pause) And I'll watch." He walked away, heartbreaking, even including us.

After Beth's death, Jo told her mother, "I care more to be loved. I want to be loved." even though she already knew that was not the same as loving. She said, "I just... I just feel... I just feel like... Women, they... They have minds and they have souls, as well as just hearts. And they've got ambition and they've got talent, as well as just beauty. And I'm so sick of people saying that love is just all a woman is fit for. I'm so sick of it!... But I'm... I'm so lonely." She cried, with my tears of empathy. Every time I heard about this. Like Jo said, "If I was a girl in a book, this would all be so easy. Just give up the world happily."

Afterward, when Friedrich came and found her, Laurie stood by, asking several times: "Who is this, who are you?", "Can someone tell me who this man is?", "I'm Laurie, who are you?" He finally watched another man walking into Jo's life. Although I insist he was still in love with her, otherwise why would he care most about this? I don't know. Maybe he had moved on, saying that just as a friend? I don't know about this sort of thing at all. Too sad to let it go.

I noticed Timothee Chalamet because of the DUNE trailer I saw around one or two months ago, although I adored more Freddie Highmore then starting to watch many of his conversations as an actor. I never thought I would feel so regretful for Timothee Chalamet (to be specific, Laurie and Jo) since his good-looking isn't quite of my type actually. Blaise returned to save Noah at the cost of his life after Noah died for saving him, which hit me deeply. Cyclically, endlessly, this tragedy.

Now I'd like to make a wish, a wish that might never come true.
